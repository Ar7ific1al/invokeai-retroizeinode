# Retroize Nodes
This is a collection of Nodes for InvokeAI to "Retroize" images. Any image can be given a fresh coat of retro paint with these nodes, either from your gallery or from within the graph itself. For full information on each of the Nodes, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/Ar7ific1al/invokeai-retroizeinode/wiki).

## Thanks and Stuff
- [YMGenesis](https://github.com/ymgenesis) for helping figure some things out, providing advice and tips for improvements :)
- @dwringer on InvokeAI Discord server for the Image Enhance node. I gutted it and used it as a starting point. lol It also served as some inspiration for these nodes.
- [Astropulse](https://github.com/Astropulse) for their [sd-palettize](https://github.com/Astropulse/sd-palettize/tree/main) and [pixeldetector](https://github.com/Astropulse/pixeldetector) projects which served as direct inspiration for this project.

## Palette Credit
Since the palette images in the root `palettes` folder are cloned from Astropulse's sd-palettize repo, I'll mirror the credit for those palettes here:
